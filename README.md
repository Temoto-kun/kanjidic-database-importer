# kanjidic-database-importer

Script that imports parsed KANJIDIC data to a database.

## Why?

This is a complement app for [`kanjidic-reader`](https://github.com/Temoto-kun/kanjidic-reader) in which it parses KANJIDIC data, while `kanjidic-database-importer` imports the parsed data to a database, SQL or NoSQL.

You might want to check out [`kanjidic-exporter`](https://github.com/Temoto-kun/kanjidic-exporter) for producing output from parsed KANJIDIC data.
